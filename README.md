# Insurance Competitive Dashboard
This is an example of a custom dashboard I built using python with the bokeh package looking at the overall premium at certain companies. 
The dashboard contains a dropdown to change what variable the graphs show as well as a slider to change the ranges. The code was run through PyCharm.
